#Task 2: Write a query that directly answers question(s) from a business stakeholder
#Question: How many users scanned in each month?
select date_format(date_scanned, '%Y-%m') as months, count(distinct user_id) as scanned_users from receipts
group by date_format(date_scanned, '%Y-%m')

#Question: Which user spent the most money in the month of August
select * from
(select date_format(date_scanned, '%Y-%m') as months, user_id, sum(total_spent) as individual_spent, row_number() over(partition by date_format(date_scanned, '%Y-%m') order by  sum(total_spent) desc) as num from receipts
where month(finished_date) = 8
group by date_format(date_scanned, '%Y-%m'), user_id) a
where num = 1
#Ans: In the August of 2021, user 609ab37f7a2e8f2f95ae968f spent most money; in the August of 2022, user 5ffb49a847903912705e9a64 turned to be the one spent most.
